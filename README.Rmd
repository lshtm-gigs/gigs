## Overview
Produced as part of the Guidance for International Growth Standards project at
the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, **gigs** provides a single,
simple interface for working with the WHO Child Growth standards and outputs
from the `r intergrowth21st` project. You will find functions for converting
from anthropometric measures (e.g. weight or length) to z-scores and centiles,
and the inverse. Also included are functions for classifying newborn and infant
growth according to literature-based cut-offs.

**gigs** is of use to anyone interested in fetal and child growth, including
child health researchers, policymakers, and clinicians. This package is best
suited to growth data where the gestational age (GA) of each child is known, as
the use of the growth standards included in **gigs** is GA-dependent.
We recommend you check out the
[available standards](#available-international-growth-standards) section to
see if your anthropometric measurements can be converted to z-scores/centiles by
**gigs**. We recommend using **gigs** to generate continuous or categorical
measures of fetal/newborn/child growth, which can then be used in downstream
analyses.

## Installation
```{r installation, eval = FALSE}
# You can install the development version from GitHub with `remotes`:
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github(repo = "lshtm-gigs/gigs")
```

## Terminology
```{r srr-tags-2, eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
#' @srrstats {G1.3} Explained z-scores and centiles prior to discussing
#'   functions which convert between these and measured values.
```
GIGS operates on anthropometric measurements, and can convert between these and
*z-scores*/*centiles*. Z-scores and centiles represent the location of a
measurement within a normal distribution of values, such that:

* A *z-score* is the number of standard deviations from the mean for a given
  anthropometric measurement (e.g. height or weight).
* A *centile* represents the proportion of measurements in some distribution
  which we would expect to be lower than a measurement we've taken. In *gigs*,
  these are represented as a value between `0` and `1`. For example, `0.5`
  corresponds to the 50<sup>th</sup> centile (i.e. the mean), whereas `0.75`
  corresponds to the 75<sup>th</sup> centile.

In growth data, z-scores and centiles represent the size a fetus, newborn, or
child relative to its peers. Its size is considered relative to some
standardising variable, which is usually age but could also be another variable
such as their length. By tracking a child's relative size as they
grow, you can see if they are achieving their growth potential or not. If not,
this may indicate underlying issues such as ill health or undernutrition.

## Classification functions
GIGS includes a number of functions which permit fast identification of at-risk
infants through classification of suboptimal growth. The cut-offs used are
sourced from research literature; you can check the function documentation to
see these sources.

### Growth classification in `data.frame`-like objects
Use the `classify_growth()` function to quickly compute growth indicators in
`data.frame`-like objects. All `classify_*()`-style functions in GIGS use
[data-masking](https://rlang.r-lib.org/reference/args_data_masking.html), so you
provide a `data.frame`-like object in the `.data` argument and then refer to
your column names directly. In `classify_growth()`, you can also use the
`.analyses` argument to specify which growth indicators you want to classify.
```{r examples_classification}
life6mo_newborns <- gigs::life6mo[life6mo$age_days == 0, ]

# Use classify_growth() to get multiple growth indicators at once
life6mo_classified <- classify_growth(
  .data = life6mo_newborns,
  weight_kg = weight_g / 1000,
  lenht_cm = len_cm,
  gest_days = gestage,
  age_days = age_days,
  sex = as.character(sex),
  .analyses = c("svn", "stunting")
)

head(life6mo_classified, n = 4)
```

When using `classify_growth()`, you will be informed which of the analyses you
wanted to run were successful. In the example below, because `lenht_cm` is not
specified, stunting indicators cannot be computed.
```{r examples_classification3}
life6mo_classified <- classify_growth(
  .data = life6mo_newborns,
  weight_kg = weight_g / 1000,
  gest_days = gestage,
  age_days = age_days,
  sex = as.character(sex),
  .analyses = c("svn", "stunting")
)

head(life6mo_classified, n = 4)
```

You can also use `classify_*()` functions which are specific to the growth
indicator you'd like to calculate, for example `classify_svn()`:
```{r examples_classification2}
# Small vulnerable newborns
life6mo_svn <- classify_svn(
  .data = life6mo_newborns,
  weight_kg = weight_g / 1000,
  gest_days = gestage,
  sex = as.character(sex)
)

head(life6mo_svn, n = 4)
```

## Conversion functions

### Available international growth standards
GIGS facilitates the proper use of international growth standards, which
are growth charts developed using international samples of healthy singleton
children born to mothers that had their health needs met during pregnancy.
They represent an international standard of 'optimal' growth. GIGS implements
international growth standards from the WHO and `r intergrowth21st` project:

### Usage

Conversion functions are named according to the set of standards in use, the
component standard from that set, then the type of conversion. For example, to
convert *values to z-scores* in the *weight-for-GA* standard from the
*`r intergrowth21st` Newborn Size Standards* would be:
  `ig_nbs`/`_wfga`/`_value2zscore()`

Similarly, the conversion of length-for-age values to centiles in term and
preterm infants could be performed with the WHO Child Growth standards and
`r intergrowth21st` Postnatal Growth of Preterm Infants standards,
respectively:

* Term infants:    `who_gs`/`_lhfa`/`_value2zscore()`
* Preterm infants: `ig_png`/`_lfa`/`_value2centile()`

If the component standard is not included in the function call, it should be
passed to the `acronym` parameter of the general function call. For example,
these two function calls would behave in the same way:
```{r acronym_param}
ig_nbs_value2zscore(y = 25.7, gest_days = 182, sex = "F", acronym = "hcfga") |>
  round(digits = 2)

ig_nbs_hcfga_value2zscore(headcirc_cm = 25.7, gest_days = 182, sex = "F") |>
  round(digits = 2)
```

### Values to z-scores/centiles
These functions allow easy conversion from measured values to z-scores or
centiles for the standard used.
```{r example_v2zp}
# Convert from z-scores for individual values...
ig_nbs_value2zscore(y = 0.785, gest_days = 182, sex = "F", acronym = "wfga") |>
  round(digits = 2)

# .. or for multiple inputs
ig_nbs_wfga_value2centile(weight_kg = 0.785,
                          gest_days = seq(175, 196, by = 7),
                          sex = "F") |>
  round(digits = 2)

# You can do the same for centiles
ig_png_wfa_value2centile(weight_kg = c(2.86, 3.12, 3.12, 3.43, 3.77, 4.10),
                         pma_weeks = 40,
                         sex = "M") |>
  round(digits = 2)
```

### Z-scores/centiles to values
These functions convert z-scores to expected anthropometric measurements. They
are mostly useful for the creation of reference curves (see below).
```{r example_zp2v}
# Convert from z-scores for individual values...
ig_nbs_zscore2value(z = 0, gest_days = 182, sex = "F", acronym = "wfga") |>
  round(digits = 3)

# .. or for multiple inputs
ig_nbs_wfga_zscore2value(z = 0, gest_days = seq(182, 204, by = 7), sex = "F") |>
  round(digits = 3)

# You can do the same for centiles
ig_png_wfa_centile2value(p = c(0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 0.9),
                            pma_weeks = 40,
                            sex = "M") |>
  round(digits = 2)
```

#### Reference curves
We can use gigs to generate reference curves for the standards by getting
curves for the expected weight at multiple z-scores across multiple gestational
ages. We would usually recommend [`ggplot2`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) for
such visualisation, but do not use it here to reduce our package's dependencies.
```{r example_zp2v_curves, dev = "png"}
z_score_range <- -2:2
gestage_range <- 168:230
ref <- mapply(z_score_range,
               FUN = function(z) {
                 gigs::ig_nbs_wfga_zscore2value(z = z,
                                                gest_days = gestage_range,
                                                sex = "F")
               })
matplot(ref, x = gestage_range, col = 1:5, type = "l", lty = 2:6,
        xlab = "Gestational age (days)",
        ylab = "Weight (kg)")
title(main = "Weight-for-GA in very preterm newborns")
legend(x = min(gestage_range) + 1, y = ref[length(ref)], legend = 2:-2,
       title = "Z-score", col = 5:1, lty = 2:6)
```

# Other packages

Other R packages can be used to analyse growth data with international
standards, but have limitations which are not present in gigs. There are also
software packages external to R which implement these standards. The table
below describes these packages, and to what extent they have implemented
functions that let users convert anthropometric measurements to
z-scores/centiles in each set of standards implemented in gigs - the WHO Child
Growth standards, `r intergrowth21st` Newborn Size standards (including Very
Preterm), and the `r intergrowth21st` Postnatal Growth standards for preterm
infants. A green tick (✅) indicates that all possible standards are included in
a package, a red cross (❌) indicates that these standards are completely
missing, and an exclamation mark (❕) indicates that some of these standards are
implemented but not others.
