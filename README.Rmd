## Overview
Produced as part of the Guidance for International Growth Standards project,
**gigs** provides a single, simple interface for working with the WHO Child
Growth standards and outputs from the `r intergrowth21st` project. You will
find functions for converting from anthropometric measures (e.g. weight or
length) to z-scores and centiles, and the inverse. Also included are functions
for classifying newborn and infant growth according to literature-based
cut-offs.

**gigs** is be of use to anyone interested in fetal and child growth,
including child health researchers, policymakers, and clinicians. This package
is best suited to growth data where the gestational age of each child is known,
as the use of the growth standards included in **gigs** is gestational
age-dependent. We recommend you check out the [available
standards](#available-standards) section to see if your anthropometric
measurements can be converted to z-scores/centiles by **gigs**. We recommend
using **gigs** to generate continuous or categorical measures of
fetal/newborn/child growth, which can then be used in downstream analyses.

## Installation
```{r installation, eval = FALSE}
# You can install the development version from GitHub with `remotes`:
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github(repo = "lshtm-gigs/gigs")

## Conversion functions
### Terminology
```{r srr-tags-2, eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
#' @srrstats {G1.3} Explained z-scores and centiles prior to discussing
#'   functions which convert between these and measured values.
```
The package operates with on measured anthropometric values, and can convert
between these and *z-scores*/*centiles*. Z-scores and centiles represent the
location of a measurement within a normal distribution of values, such that:

* A *z-score* is the number of standard deviations from the mean for a given
  anthropometric measurement (e.g. height or weight).
* A *centile* represents the proportion of measurements in some distribution
  which we would expect to be lower than a measurement we've taken, represented
  as a value between 0 and 1.

### Usage
Conversion functions are named according to the set of standards in use, the
component standard from that set, then the type of conversion. For example, to
convert *values to z-scores* in the *weight-for-GA* standard from the
*`r intergrowth21st` Newborn Size Standards* would be:
  `ig_nbs`/`_wfga`/`_value2zscore()`

Similarly, the conversion of length-for-age values to centiles in term and
preterm infants could be performed with the WHO Child Growth standards and
`r intergrowth21st` Postnatal Growth of Preterm Infants standards,
respectively:

* Term infants:    `who_gs`/`_lhfa`/`_value2zscore()`
* Preterm infants: `ig_png`/`_lfa`/`_value2centile()`

If the component standard is not included in the function call, it should be
passed to the `acronym` parameter of the general function call. For example,
these two function calls would behave in the same way:
```{r acronym_param}
ig_nbs_value2zscore(y = 25.7, gest_days = 182, sex = "F", acronym = "hcfga") |>
  round(digits = 2)

ig_nbs_hcfga_value2zscore(headcirc_cm = 25.7, gest_days = 182, sex = "F") |>
  round(digits = 2)
```

A vector of `acronym` values can be used if you want to convert with different
standards for each input.

### Values to z-scores/centiles
These functions allow easy conversion from measured values to z-scores or
centiles for the standard used.
```{r example_v2zp}
# Convert from z-scores for individual values...
ig_nbs_value2zscore(y = 0.785, gest_days = 182, sex = "F", acronym = "wfga") |>
  round(digits = 2)

# .. or for multiple inputs
ig_nbs_wfga_value2centile(weight_kg = 0.785,
                          gest_days = seq(175, 196, by = 7),
                          sex = "F") |>
  round(digits = 2)

# You can do the same for centiles
ig_png_wfa_value2centile(weight_kg = c(2.86, 3.12, 3.12, 3.43, 3.77, 4.10),
                         pma_weeks = 40,
                         sex = "M") |>
  round(digits = 2)
```

### Z-scores/centiles to values
These functions convert z-scores to expected anthropometric measurements. They
are mostly useful for the creation of reference curves (see below).
```{r example_zp2v}
# Convert from z-scores for individual values...
ig_nbs_zscore2value(z = 0, gest_days = 182, sex = "F", acronym = "wfga") |>
  round(digits = 3)

# .. or for multiple inputs
ig_nbs_wfga_zscore2value(z = 0, gest_days = seq(182, 204, by = 7), sex = "F") |>
  round(digits = 3)

# You can do the same for centiles
ig_png_wfa_centile2value(p = c(0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 0.9),
                            pma_weeks = 40,
                            sex = "M") |>
  round(digits = 2)
```

#### Reference curves
We can use gigs to generate reference curves for the standards by getting
curves for the expected weight at multiple z-scores across multiple gestational
ages. We would usually recommend [`ggplot2`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) for
such visualisation, but do not use it here to reduce our package's dependencies.
```{r example_zp2v_curves, dev = "png"}
z_score_range <- -2:2
gestage_range <- 168:230
ref <- mapply(z_score_range,
               FUN = function(z) {
                 gigs::ig_nbs_wfga_zscore2value(z = z,
                                                gest_days = gestage_range,
                                                sex = "F")
               })
matplot(ref, x = gestage_range, col = 1:5, type = "l", lty = 2:6,
        xlab = "Gestational age (days)",
        ylab = "Weight (kg)")
title(main = "Weight-for-GA in very preterm newborns")
legend(x = min(gestage_range) + 1, y = ref[length(ref)], legend = 2:-2,
       title = "Z-score", col = 5:1, lty = 2:6)
```

## Classification functions
These functions allow for quick identification of at-risk infants through
classification of suboptimal growth. The cut-offs used are sourced from research
literature; you can check the function documentation to see these sources.
```{r examples_classification}
# Size for gestational age
classify_sfga(
  weight_kg = c(2.1, 3.2, 4.5),
  gest_days = c(252, 259, 290),
  sex = "M"
)

# Small vulnerable newborns
classify_svn(
  weight_kg = c(2.1, 3.2, 4.5),
  gest_days = c(252, 259, 290),
  sex = "M"
)

# Stunting, i.e. low length increase relative to age
classify_stunting(
  lenht_cm = c(42.3, 75.4, 72.83),
  age_days = c(252, 525, 245),
  gest_days = c(238, 259, 266),
  sex = "M"
)

# Wasting, i.e. low weight increase relative to length/height
classify_wasting(
  weight_kg = c(5.75, 2.18, 5.30, 6.75),
  lenht_cm = c(67.7, 46.6, 55.8, 80.1),
  gest_days = c(268, 247, 250, 278),
  age_days = c(45, 33, 230, 278),
  sex = c("F", "M", "F", "M"),
)

# Weight-for-age, i.e. low weight increase relative to age
classify_wfa(
  weight_kg = c(2.1, 7.2, 6.1, 9.1, 9.4),
  age_days = c(435, 501, 323, 201, 154),
  gest_days = c(36, 27, 37, 40, 28),
  sex = c("M", "M", "F", "F", "F")
)
```

# Other packages

Other R packages can be used to analyse growth data with international
standards, but have limitations which are not present in gigs. There are also
software packages external to R which implement these standards. The table
below describes these packages, and to what extent they have implemented
functions that let users convert anthropometric measurements to
z-scores/centiles in each set of standards implemented in gigs - the WHO Child
Growth standards, `r intergrowth21st` Newborn Size standards (including Very
Preterm), and the `r intergrowth21st` Postnatal Growth standards for preterm
infants. A green tick (✅) indicates that all possible standards are included in
a package, a red cross (❌) indicates that these standards are completely
missing, and an exclamation mark (❕) indicates that some of these standards are
implemented but not others.

```{r arrows, echo = FALSE}

We have benchmarked some of these implementations against each other for
conversion of values to z-scores in the WHO Child Growth standards. At 100,000
inputs, each package took:

| Package         | Time taken (100,000 inputs) |
|-----------------|-----------------------------|
| `r growthstans` | 121 ms                      |
| `r gigs_r`      | 132 ms                      |
| `r childsds`    | 132 ms                      |
| `r gigs_stata`  | 0.4 seconds                 |
| `r zanthro`     | 2.05 seconds                |

The results can be seen in the online benchmarking
[article](https://lshtm-gigs.github.io/gigs/articles/benchmarking.html).

The WHO and `r intergrowth21st` standards are also available in standalone form,
available from the [WHO
website](https://www.who.int/tools/child-growth-standards/software) and
[`r intergrowth21st`
website](https://intergrowth21.tghn.org/intergrowth-21st-applications/),
respectively.
The `r intergrowth21st` website also includes download links for Excel-based
calculators in some standards.
