\usage{
classify_wfa(weight_kg, age_days, gest_days, sex, outliers = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{weight_kg}{Numeric vector of length one or more with weight
value(s) in kg.}

\item{age_days}{Numeric vector of length one or more with age(s) in days
for each child. Should be between \code{0} to \code{1856} days. By default, gigs will
replace out-of-bounds elements in \code{age_days} with \code{NA} and warn you. This
behaviour can be customised using the functions in \link{gigs_options}.}

\item{gest_days}{Numeric vector of length one or more with gestational
age(s) at birth in days between \code{168} and \code{300}. By default, gigs will
replace out-of-bounds elements in \code{gest_days} with \code{NA} and warn you. This
behaviour can be customised using the functions in \link{gigs_options}.}

\item{sex}{Character vector of length one or more with sex(es), either \code{"M"}
(male) or \code{"F"} (female). This argument is case-sensitive. By default, gigs
will replace elements of \code{sex} which are not \code{"M"} or \code{"F"} with \code{NA}
and warn you. This behaviour can be customised using the functions in
\link{gigs_options}.}

\item{outliers}{A single \code{TRUE} or \code{FALSE} value specifying whether
implausible z-score value thresholds should be applied. Default = \code{FALSE}.}
}
\value{
An object of class factor with the same length as the longest input
vector, containing weight-for-age classifications. Its levels are
\code{c("underweight_severe", "underweight", "normal", "overweight")} if
\code{outliers = FALSE} (the default), else \code{c("underweight_severe", "underweight", "normal", "overweight", "outlier")}.

\strong{Category}    \tab \strong{Factor level}  \tab
\strong{Z-score bounds} \cr
Severely underweight \tab \code{"underweight_severe"} \tab \code{z} ≤ -3      \cr
Underweight          \tab \code{"underweight"}        \tab -3 < \code{z} ≤ -2 \cr
Normal weight        \tab \code{"normal_weight"}      \tab \code{abs(z)} < 2  \cr
Overweight           \tab \code{"overweight"}         \tab \code{z} ≥ 2       \cr

\description{
Classify weight-for-age z-scores using the WHO Child Growth Standards or
INTERGROWTH-21\if{html}{\out{<sup>}}st\if{html}{\out{</sup>}} Postnatal Growth standards depending on the
gestational age at birth for the infant. Severely underweight is less than 3
SD below the mean, underweight is less than 2 SD below the mean, and
overweight is > 2 SDs above the mean.
}
\note{
Input vectors will be recycled by \code{\link[vctrs:vec_recycle]{vctrs::vec_recycle_common()}}.
Outlier z-score bounds are sourced from the referenced WHO report, and
classification cut-offs from the DHS manual.
