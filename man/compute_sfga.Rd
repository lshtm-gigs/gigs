\title{Get size-for-gestational age categories using multiple vectors and the
INTERGROWTH-21\if{html}{\out{<sup>}}st\if{html}{\out{</sup>}} weight-for-gestational age standard}
\usage{
compute_sfga(weight_kg, gest_days, sex, severe = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{weight_kg}{Numeric vector of length one or more with weight value(s) in
kg. It is assumed that weight measurements provided to this function are
birth weights recorded <12 hours after an infant's birth.}

\item{gest_days}{Numeric vector of length one or more with gestational ages
in days. Classifications can only be computed when \code{gest_days} is between
\code{168} and \code{300}, as these are the limits of the INTERGROWTH-21\if{html}{\out{<sup>}}st\if{html}{\out{</sup>}}
Newborn Size standards (including the Very Preterm standards). By default,
gigs will warn you about elements of \code{gest_days} which are either outside
these bounds, are \code{NA}, or are \code{Inf}. You can customise this behaviour
using the \link[=gigs_options]{GIGS package-level options}.}

\item{sex}{Character vector of length one or more with sex(es), either \code{"M"}
(male) or \code{"F"} (female). This argument is case-sensitive. By default, gigs
will replace elements of \code{sex} which are not \code{"M"} or \code{"F"} with \code{NA}
and warn you. You can customise this behaviour using the \link[=gigs_options]{GIGS package-level options}.}

\item{severe}{A single logical value specifying whether to categorise SGA
values below the third centile (\code{0.03}) as \code{"SGA(<3)"}. Default = \code{FALSE}.}
}
\value{
An object of class factor with the same length as the longest input
vector, containing size-for-GA classifications. If \code{severe = FALSE}, levels
are \code{c("SGA", "AGA", "LGA")}. If \code{severe = TRUE}, levels are \code{c("SGA(<3)", "SGA", "AGA", "LGA")}. By default, gigs will inform you this object
contains unused factor levels. You can change this behaviour using the
\link[=gigs_options]{GIGS package-level option}
\code{.gigs_options$handle_unused_levels}.

\description{
Get size-for-gestational age categories using multiple vectors and the
INTERGROWTH-21\if{html}{\out{<sup>}}st\if{html}{\out{</sup>}} weight-for-gestational age standard
}
\details{
Cut-offs for size-for-gestational age categorisations are:

\tabular{lll}{
\strong{Category} \tab \strong{Factor level} \tab
\strong{Centile bounds} \cr
Severely small-for-GA \tab \code{"SGA(<3)"} \tab \code{p} < 0.03      \cr
Small-for-GA          \tab \code{"SGA"}     \tab \code{p} < 0.1       \cr
Appropriate-for-GA    \tab \code{"AGA"}     \tab 0.1 =< \code{p} =< 0.9 \cr
Large-for-GA          \tab \code{"LGA"}     \tab \code{p} > 0.9
}
}
\note{
Input vectors are recycled by \code{\link[vctrs:vec_recycle]{vctrs::vec_recycle_common()}}, and must
adhere to the \link{vctrs} recycling rules.
