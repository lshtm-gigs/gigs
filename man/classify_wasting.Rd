\usage{
classify_wasting(
  .data,
  weight_kg,
  lenht_cm,
  age_days,
  gest_days,
  sex,
  id = NULL,
  .new = c("wlz", "wasting", "wasting_outliers")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{.data}{A \code{data.frame}-like tabular object with one or more rows. Must
be permissible by \code{\link[checkmate:checkDataFrame]{checkmate::assert_data_frame()}}, so you can also supply
a \code{tibble}, \code{data.table}, or similar.}

\item{weight_kg}{<\code{\link[rlang:args_data_masking]{data-masking}}> The name of a
column in \code{.data} which is a numeric vector of birth weight values in kg.
It is assumed that weight measurements provided to this function are
birth weights recorded <12 hours after an infant's birth.}

\item{lenht_cm}{<\code{\link[rlang:args_data_masking]{data-masking}}> The name of a
column in \code{.data} which is a numeric vector of length/height values in cm.}

\item{age_days}{<\code{\link[rlang:args_data_masking]{data-masking}}> The name of a
column in \code{.data} which is a numeric vector of age values in days.}

\item{gest_days}{<\code{\link[rlang:args_data_masking]{data-masking}}> The name of a
column in \code{.data} which is a numeric vector of gestational age(s) at birth
in days. This column, in conjunction with the column referred to by
\code{age_days}, is used to select which growth standard to use for each
observation.}

\item{sex}{<\code{\link[rlang:args_data_masking]{data-masking}}> The name of a
column in \code{.data} which is a case-sensitive character vector of sexes,
either \code{"M"} (male) or \code{"F"} (female). By default, gigs will warn you if
any elements of \code{sex} are not \code{"M"} or \code{"F"}, or are missing (\code{NA}). You
can customise this behaviour using the \link[=gigs_options]{GIGS package-level options}.}

\item{id}{<\code{\link[rlang:args_data_masking]{data-masking}}> The name of a
column in \code{.data} which is a factor variable with IDs for each observation.
When not \code{NULL}, this variable is used to ensure that only the first
measurement taken from each infant is used as a birth measure. If all your
data is from one individual, leave this parameter as \code{NULL}. Default =
\code{NULL}.}

\item{.new}{A three-length character vector with names for the output
columns. These inputs will be repaired if necessary using
\code{\link[vctrs:vec_as_names]{vctrs::vec_as_names()}}, which will print any changes to the console. If
any elements in \code{.new} are the same as elements in \code{colnames(.data)}, the
function will throw an error. Default = \code{c("wlz", "wasting", "wasting_outliers")}.}
}
\value{
A tabular object of the same class that was provided as \code{.data},
with three new columns named according to \code{.new}. These columns will be
(from left to right):
\itemize{
\item \code{wlz} - Numeric vector of weight-for-length/height zscores
\item \code{wasting} - Factor of wasting categories without outlier flagging
\item \code{wasting_outliers} - Factor of wasting categories with outlier flagging
}
}
\description{
Classify wasting in \code{data.frame}-like objects with GIGS-recommended growth
standards

\details{
Cut-offs for wasting categories are:

\tabular{lll}{
\strong{Category} \tab \strong{Factor level} \tab
\strong{Z-score bounds} \cr
Severe wasting \tab \code{"wasting_severe"}       \tab \code{wlz} ≤ -3      \cr
Wasting        \tab \code{"wasting"}              \tab -3 < \code{wlz} ≤ -2 \cr
No wasting     \tab \code{"not_wasting"}          \tab \code{abs(wlz)} < 2  \cr
Overweight     \tab \code{"overweight"}           \tab \code{wlz} ≥ 2       \cr
Outlier        \tab \code{"outlier"}              \tab \code{abs(wlz)} > 5
