\usage{
classify_wasting(
  weight_kg,
  lenht_cm,

  gest_days,

  outliers = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{weight_kg}{Numeric vector of length one or more with weight
value(s) in kg.}

\item{lenht_cm}{Numeric vector of length one or more with length/height
measurement(s) in cm.}

\item{age_days}{Numeric vector of length one or more with age(s) in days
for each child. Should be between \code{0} to \code{1856} days. By default, gigs will
replace out-of-bounds elements in \code{age_days} with \code{NA} and warn you. This
behaviour can be customised using the functions in \link{gigs_options}.}

\item{gest_days}{Numeric vector of length one or more with gestational
age(s) at birth in days between \code{168} and \code{300}. By default, gigs will
replace out-of-bounds elements in \code{gest_days} with \code{NA} and warn you. This
behaviour can be customised using the functions in \link{gigs_options}.}

\item{sex}{Character vector of length one or more with sex(es), either \code{"M"}
(male) or \code{"F"} (female). This argument is case-sensitive. By default, gigs
will replace elements of \code{sex} which are not \code{"M"} or \code{"F"} with \code{NA}
and warn you. This behaviour can be customised using the functions in
\link{gigs_options}.}

\item{outliers}{A single \code{TRUE} or \code{FALSE} value specifying whether
implausible z-score value thresholds should be applied. Default = \code{FALSE}.}
}
\value{
An object of class factor with the same length as the longest input
vector, containing wasting classifications. Its levels are
\code{c("wasting_severe", "wasting", "not_wasting", "overweight")} if \code{outliers = FALSE} (the default), else \code{c("wasting_severe", "wasting", "not_wasting", "overweight", "outlier")}.

\description{
Classify wasting (low weight-for-length/height) using the
INTERGROWTH-21\if{html}{\out{<sup>}}st\if{html}{\out{</sup>}} weight-for-length or WHO Child Growth standards,
specifically either the weight-for-length or weight-for-height standard
depending on the age of the child. Severe stunting is \verb{< -3} SD relative to
the mean expected weight, whereas moderate wasting is \verb{< -2} SD from the
mean.

Input vectors will be recycled by \code{\link[vctrs:vec_recycle]{vctrs::vec_recycle_common()}}.
Outlier z-score bounds are sourced from the referenced WHO report, and
classification cut-offs from the DHS manual.
