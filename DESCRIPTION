Description: Convert between anthropometric measures and z-scores/centiles
    in multiple growth standards, and classify fetal, newborn, and child
    growth accordingly. With a simple interface to growth standards from
    the World Health Organisation and International Fetal and Newborn
    Growth Consortium for the 21st Century, gigs makes growth assessment
    easy and reproducible for clinicians, researchers and policy-makers.
